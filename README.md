My console app is used for tracking stats for your baby.  The whole thing is run through a master loop that pulls up a list of options.  The loop is tied to my other methods so that when a user selects something the appropriate method runs.  I have one method that adds a new profile to the list. Another that checks to see if the profile exists.  A third that allows you to add new measurements and then calculate how much the profile has grown.  Finally a method that calculates age based on the current date and previously given data.  Ultimately, I would not consider this to be a finished application as it would ideally be tied to a JSON file that would then keep permanent records of each profile. As it stands, I have instantiated several profiles already and others can be added when used, but not stored permanently.  I would also like to add a list of feedings tied to specific profiles.  This would keep track of how much and and for how long the baby feeds, measuring how each either increase or decrease.  Time permitting I will add.
